                <h2>Who is the Upright Man?</h2>
                <p>Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara was a Burkinabé revolutionary and President of Burkina Faso from 1983 to

                    Burkina Faso was producing 3,900 kilograms per hectare (3,500 lb/acre) of wheat.

                <li><strong>1987</strong> - Creates food self-sufficiency. States "Our country produces enough to feed
                    us all. Alas, for lack of
                    organization, we are forced to beg for food aid. It's this aid that instills in our spirits the
                    attitude of beggars.". He goes on to ban female genital mutilation, forced marriages and
                    polygamy in support of women's rights and gender equality.</li>

                <p id="italize">He may have had his flaws like every other man but his positive work in mapping a
                    self-sustainable route to African success is undoubtedly proof of a legend at work. His ideas live
                    on! In his own words, “While revolutionaries as individuals can be murdered, you cannot kill ideas.” <br>
                     20 years after his assassination, Sankara was commemorated on 15 October 2007 in
                    ceremonies that took
